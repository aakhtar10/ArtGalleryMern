**Art Gallery MERN Project**

Welcome to the Art Gallery MERN Project! This project is designed to provide a platform for artists to showcase their work and for art enthusiasts to explore and purchase artworks.

### Deployed Link:

The project is deployed and accessible at [Art Gallery](https://art-gallary-do7i.vercel.app/). Feel free to visit and explore the art gallery online.


### Features:

1. **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in as either an artist or a collector/explorer.

2. **Artist Profile**: Artists have their own profiles where they can upload and showcase their artwork, along with a bio and contact information.

3. **Artwork Listings**: Collectors/explorers can browse through a variety of artworks listed on the platform. Each artwork comes with details such as the artist's name, description, price, and images.

4. **Search and Filter**: Users can search for specific artworks or filter artworks based on criteria such as artist, genre, medium, price, etc.

5. **Purchase Artworks**: Collectors/explorers can purchase artworks directly from the platform. They can add items to their cart, proceed to checkout, and make payments securely.

6. **Messaging System**: Users can communicate with each other through a messaging system. Collectors/explorers can inquire about artworks, negotiate prices, or discuss commissions with artists.

- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js used to build the backend server and API endpoints.
  
- **React.js**: JavaScript library used for building the user interface and creating interactive components.
  
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment used for running the server-side code.
